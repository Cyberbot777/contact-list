# Contact List App (React + Context)

A sleek, dark-themed Contact List app built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the Context API.

This project demonstrates using **global state management** with React Context, TypeScript typing, API integration, and modern page routing — all in a professional, minimalist UI.
